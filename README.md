# LibraryManagementSystem
Final Project to manage a Library Management System

Library Management System is developed to perform all the functions a library needs to execute. The librarians keep the record of all the assets of library in the system including books, members and the operations between the members and the books. The members use it to check information regarding any concerned book, issue it, and return it. You have to write a C++ code to fulfill this task.\
\
The elaboration of it is as follows:\
&emsp;.  The system should have 2 panels: Librarian and User.\
&emsp;.  Each book will be identified by a unique number for all the operations and will have attributes including name, type, authors (and whatever seemed relevant to include)\
&emsp;.  Librarian will login to the system and can add, remove, edit a book.\
&emsp;.  Librarian will grant permission and manage issue and return of a book\
&emsp;.  Librarian should be able to keep record of which book is issued by which member\
&emsp;.  User will sign-up and login to the system and can request for issue or return of a book\
&emsp;.  The member will search for a book through its unique number from the list and it will be shown with all the relevant details and its current status (Available/Unavailable).\
&emsp;.  The system should be able to keep a list of issued books corresponding to each of the user\
&emsp;.  When a member returns a particular book, it will be removed from list of issued books\
&emsp;.  You should apply file handling to save and extract the entire data
